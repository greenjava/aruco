This directory contains the marker dictionaries generated in the paper:

S. Garrido-Jurado, R. Mu√±oz-Salinas, F.J Madrid-Cuevas, R. Medina-Carnicer, 
"Generation of fiducial marker dictionaries using mixed integer linear programming",

These dictionaries have been generated using Integer Linear Programming, surpassing
the inter-marker distances obtained by other generating methods.
This means these dictionaries have a better error detection and correction capabilities.

The dictionaries are presented in the ArUco HRM format, so they can be directly be employed
in ArUco using the HRM feature.

- The 'optimal' folder contains the dictionaries generated by the first model in the paper.
These dictionaries are optimal in terms of inter-marker distance but only cover a small range
of dictionary sizes and number of bits (only 3x3 and 4x4 bits).

- The 'suboptimal' folder contains the dictionaries generated by the second model of the paper.
In these case the dictionaries do not guarantee optimality but still surpass the other generating
alternatives. The marker sizes covered are 4x4, 6x6, 10x10 and 25x25 bits, and the dictionary size
is 250 markers in all cases. The 'suboptimal' folder contains one dictionary for each marker size 
while the folder 'suboptimal/all' contains all the dictionaries generated for the paper to
obtain average results.

Note: 
If you need a lower number of markers, you can simply edit the "nmarkers" parameter
in the dictionary file.
To generate different marker sizes or dictionary sizes see paper above or use the default
dictionary generator included in ArUco (although it will achieve lower inter-marker distances).
